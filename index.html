            <p>When there is no more space in Random Access Memory. When Lockdown is coming. When Swaty on 1+1 TV Channel prepare to break down Your Mind and Youtube can no longer stop them ...</p>
            <p>Here comes He - Javascript. The Dark Lord of Untyped data and components, he does not give up technical tasks "to do nicely" and is not afraid of calculations on the user side. But never he comes  alone, always having 3 of his faithful friends by his side: jQuery, React.js and Node.js. May the SASS Force be with You and Jedi Brotherhood of the Light Swords will continue their path to wisdom</p>
